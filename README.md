# Miller Piano Studio Website ðŸŽ¹

This is a custom web application I built for my momâ€™s small business â€” *Miller Piano Studio*. She is a private piano teacher and needed a site to help students and parents stay informed, and view the studio schedule.

The frontend is built using **React** with **Vite** for fast development and live updates. It also includes some basic ESLint rules to help maintain code quality.

## Features

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Custom studio schedule with admin access to add events
- Integration with Google Calendar for lesson booking
- Secure login and admin-only controls
- Built-in modal for viewing and managing event details

## Tech Stack
